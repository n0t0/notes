### Accelerate and Modernize Container Application Delivery with containers and SUSE

1. To be competitive, you must innovate as rapidly as possible

experiment --> feedback --> ideas --> experiment --> feedback --> ideas --> exp.. (innovation wheel)

Automate and Abstract 

### Benefits of containers

1. defined as code
2. easier to manage applications 
3. standardized packaging 

### Right Foundation to Streamline Application Lifecycle

1. split tasks 
2. independent scaling 

### Monitoring to Optimize End User Experience 

1. metrics, logs, and traces
2. real time metrics

### CI/CD

5x 

### Security and Compliance Across the Entire App Lifecycle

1. authenticate
2. authorize
3. audit and govern
4. validate

### AWS Services

1. Registry
2. Orchestration (Elastic Container Service ECS or Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes EKS)


#### Suse CaaS

### Kubernetes 

- lightweight containers instead of 1000 VMs
- fraction of the memory footprint

### Modular Kubernetes Solutions Architecture 

### SUSE + AWS

- modernize application delivery and improve release management
